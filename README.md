# ScaleDefiningWorkout

This project, created using Eclipse, focuses on defining various musical scale modes and their corresponding scale degrees. It includes classes that demonstrate the definition of different modes along with their associated scale degrees.

## Usage

This Java application serves as a practical exercise in defining musical scale modes and understanding their scale degrees. It includes classes that provide information about various modes and their corresponding scale degree values.

## Requirements

- Java
- Eclipse IDE

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run the classes to explore the definitions and scale degrees of different musical modes.

## Classes

### Mode

A class that defines various musical modes and their scale degrees. It includes information about the Ionian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian, and Locrian modes along with their corresponding scale degree values.

### ScaleModeApp

A class that provides an interactive interface for users to input a mode and retrieve its corresponding scale degrees. It utilizes the Mode class to fetch and display the scale degrees based on the user's input.

### ModeAbstract

An abstract class that serves as the base for the Mode class. It includes the basic definitions of various musical modes and their corresponding scale degrees.

### DefineScaleInterface

An interface that defines the methods for retrieving the scale degrees of different musical modes. It is implemented by the Mode class to provide access to scale degree values.

Feel free to explore these classes and experiment with the musical scale modes and their scale degrees in the context of the Java programming language.
